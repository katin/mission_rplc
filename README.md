Do you have the kind of thinking, puzzle-solving, and exploration skills that make a great cybersecurity professional?
Find out by playing Mission RPLC!

This is a golang application that you can compile for any platform and run. 
The game itself gives you the storyline and instructions, as well as your score at the end. 

This game has been specially designed to use the types of thinking and investigation skills that
would be pivotal in cybersecurity work. It will measure several things as you play, and all the
computer networking and software components in the security system you will be using have been
created just for this game, so candidates being assessed will not be able to Google answers.

Find out if you have the kind of mind that would flourish in the cybersecurity field!
No cybersecurity knowledge required! Explore, examine, investigate, experiment, learn, and
see if you can use the system to capture the thief!

Good luck!
(Candidates will want to scren-capture their final score screen to share with their interviewers.)
